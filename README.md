# DimensionAnalysis

•Quantified price volatility without prior assumptions (i.e., homoscedasticity) using the Minkowski–Bouligandbox-counting dimension applied to stochastic processes, market securities, and cryptocurrencies
•Pre-processed data gathered from nasdaq.com, yahoo!  Finance, and University of Missouri - Kansas City
•Validated Fama’s EMH hypothesis using Brownian motion’s dimension:  EMH = 1.5 , Bitcoin = 1.45, Enron = 1.02
•Used statistical hypothesis testing to find best-fit distribution and stationarity of data for normal model validation
•Data that don’t fit the normal model assumptions can be analyzed through this fractal volatility and then appliedto trading strategies
